For our own internal business purposes, such as to operate our business; operate our Digital Properties and customize the content; maintain internal records; for short-term transient use; and for quality assurance.
For our internal research and product improvement purposes, such as to evaluate the usage, performance, and safety of our vehicles, Digital Properties, products, and services; improve the quality of our vehicles, Digital Properties, products, and services and design new products and services; develop and improve algorithms, artificial intelligence, or machine learning tools and models; evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising or marketing; auditing; debugging; and other internal research.

The types of information we collect using these technologies
How we disclose or make information available to others
Choices you may have regarding these technologies
Types of cookies we use
Our Digital Properties and the third parties that we authorize may use the following tracking technologies:

- Cookies, which are a type of technology that install a small amount of information on a user's computer or other device when they visit a website. Some cookies exist only during a single session and some are persistent over multiple sessions over time.  

- Pixels, web beacons, and tags, which are types of code or transparent graphics. In addition to the uses described in Section 5.2 below, these technologies provide analytical information about the user experience and help us customize our marketing activities. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, pixels, web beacons, and tags are embedded invisibly on web pages. 

- Session replay tools, which record your interactions with our Digital Properties, such as how you move throughout our Digital Properties and engage with our webforms. In addition to the uses described in Section 5.2 below, this information helps us improve our Digital Properties and identify and fix technical issues visitors may be having with our Digital Properties.

-Embedded scripts and SDKs, which allow us to build and integrate custom apps and experiences on our Digital Properties.
Purposes for using these technologies 
We and authorized third parties use these technologies to operate our Digital Properties; remember user preferences, login details and browsing behavior; improve the performance of our Digital Properties, products, and services; conduct analytics; provide you with offers that may be of interest to you; track your activity across online properties over time to better understand your preferences and interests; conduct advertising on our Digital Properties and those of third parties; measure the effectiveness of our communications with you and advertising campaigns, including identifying how and when you engage with one of our emails; and personalize online content.  For example, we use Google Analytics to help us improve our Digital Properties, performance and user experiences. Google Analytics may use Cookies to perform their services.  To learn how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit: “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at 
www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners
.
Information collected 
These tracking technologies collect data about you and your device, such as your IP address, cookie ID, device ID, AdID, operating system, browser used, browser history, search history, and information about how you interact with our Digital Properties (such as pages on our Digital Properties that you have viewed). 
Disclosures of your information 
VW may disclose information to third parties or allow third parties to directly collect information using these technologies on our Digital Properties, such as social media companies, advertising networks, companies that provide analytics including ad tracking and reporting, security providers, and others that help us operate our business and Digital Properties. 
Your choices
Some of the third parties we work with participate with the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") and Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). The DAA and NAI provide mechanisms for you to opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members at 
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
 and 
https://optout.networkadvertising.org/
. Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from participating members. You can also refuse or delete cookies using your browser settings.  If you refuse or delete cookies, some of our Digital Properties’ functionality may be impaired.  Please refer to your browser’s Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the use of other tracking technologies.  If you change computers, devices, or browsers; use multiple computers, devices, or browsers; or delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer, device, or browser.
You may have additional rights as described in Section 12 below.
Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (“DNT”) preferences. Because there is no universal standard of how to apply that setting, we currently do not honor them.

6. Mobile Applications
In addition to mobile applications designed to allow you to use your Service Plans and certain features in the myVW app, VW may have mobile applications that you can download to your mobile device or vehicle (“VW Applications”). When you download a VW Application, there may be an opportunity for you to provide us with or for us to obtain information about you or your vehicle. If any new or different information will be disclosed or handled differently via a VW Application, the VW Application will display a Privacy Statement that will inform you how that information will be handled.  Otherwise, information collected via VW Applications will be the information identified above and will be used and disclosed as stated in this Privacy Statement.

Through the infotainment system, VW may also offer applications developed by third parties, for example Apple CarPlay or Android Auto (“3rd Party Application”). When you download a 3rd Party Application to your mobile device or vehicle, the 3rd Party Application may collect information about you or your vehicle in connection with your download or use of that application. VW is not responsible for the collection or use of information by 3rd Party Applications. We recommend that you carefully review the privacy statement and terms of use of each 3rd Party Application prior to downloading or using them. 

7. Our Commitment to Children's Privacy
The Digital Properties are not directed at, marketed to, nor intended for, children under 16 years of age.

Once you have terminated your relationship with us, we may retain your information in our systems and records in order to ensure adequate fulfillment of surviving provisions in terminated contracts, or for other legitimate business purposes, such as to demonstrate our business practices and contractual obligations or provide you with information about our products and services in case of interest. 

10. Changes to this Privacy Statement
From time to time, we may update this Privacy Statement by updating this page and by displaying the date of the last update at the top of the page.
